Project Description:

A user-friendly social application aimed at event-goers in Atlanta to display real time weather and navigation information that is useful for the users to plan their outing.

Our application will consolidate information into one place, so users do not have to use different sources to obtain their information that is important to their outing.


Essential Features:

As a user, I want to find events in Atlanta.
As a user, I want to see weather information for the day of the event. 
As a user, I want to see traffic information or alternative route.
